/**
 * Control-plane calls through the ONE platform gateway (ADR-005, a
 * `{cmd, payload}` POST), never a per-method URL.
 *
 * They had to move: `FrappeApp.call()` takes ZERO arguments and returns a
 * `FrappeCall` (frappe-js-sdk 1.12.0, `lib/frappe_app/index.d.ts`), so
 * `client.call("rpanel.…", {…})` discarded both arguments, issued no HTTP
 * request, and handed back an SDK builder object — the file manager showed
 * an empty directory and a delete reported success without deleting
 * anything. The compiler was already saying so: these two lines were
 * `TS2554: Expected 0 arguments, but got 2` on `main`.
 *
 * The explicit `baseUrl` keeps these pointed at the control plane, which
 * is what `getControlClient()` did by deliberately ignoring the session's
 * tenant site. One behavioural note: `getControlClient()` threw
 * `Unauthorized` before sending anything when there was no session; now an
 * unauthenticated call fails at the gateway instead, landing in the same
 * catch and returning the same `{ success: false }` shape with a different
 * message.
