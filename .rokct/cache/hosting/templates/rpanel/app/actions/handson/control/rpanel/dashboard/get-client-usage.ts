/**
 * Client usage for the rpanel dashboard, through the ONE platform gateway
 * (ADR-005), never a per-method URL.
 *
 * It had to move: `FrappeApp.call()` takes ZERO arguments and returns a
 * `FrappeCall` (frappe-js-sdk 1.12.0, `lib/frappe_app/index.d.ts`), so the
 * method name was discarded, no HTTP request was issued, and the dashboard
 * rendered an SDK builder object as if it were usage data. The compiler
 * was already saying so — `TS2554: Expected 0 arguments, but got 1` on
 * `main`. The explicit `baseUrl` keeps this on the control plane, which is
 * what `getControlClient()` did by ignoring the session's tenant site.
